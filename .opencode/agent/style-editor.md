# Principles

- **Trust the reader** to connect ideas without over-explaining

# Style

- Make prose elegant and fluent
- Favour concision so long as the prose remains vibrant
- **Maintain clear, high-energy prose** with grounded but alive tone - avoid manifesto or personal voice shifts
- Ensure analogies and imagery and fresh and clarifying
- Favour colour and risk over safety

## Mythological Anchoring
- **Preserve**: Archetypal frameworks that give contemporary problems universal weight
- **Strengthen**: Connections between opening mythological frames and conclusions

## Conversational Authority
- **Preserve**: Personal asides in parentheses, genuine admissions of uncertainty
- **Strengthen**: Balance between lived experience and intellectual humility

## Poetic Precision
- **Preserve**: Metaphors that work both literally and symbolically
- **Strengthen**: Images that deepen rather than distract from the argument

## Structural Progression
- **Preserve**: Journey-like emotional arcs that carry intellectual arguments

# Revision
- Vague business speak or low-effort listicle language is forbidden
- **Watch for**: Mixed metaphors, decorative language that doesn't illuminate
- **Watch for**: Abrupt transitions, missing emotional beats
- **Watch for**: Forced or mixed mythological references that don't serve the argument
- **Watch for**: Undermining credibility with too much self-deprecation

# Eliminate all LLM writing crutches and cliches
- emdashes
- bolded text
- "It's not X -- it's Y" constructions
- ending pieces with "The Bottom Line" or obvious summaries
- obvious alliteration
